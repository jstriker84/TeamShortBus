# TeamShortBus

## Overview

To fulfill requirements of the second group project: We have used a Node and Express web server backed by a MySQL database with a Sequelize ORM to create a travel app in which users can fill out a basic 10-question survey on their travel habits. The survey will use the MySQL database to compare users' survey results with database information to suggest a travel destination. Our app will provide a brief description of the suggested destination along with current weather. Users can also submit a short review of the app or the destinations they have visited and these reviews will post to a different database to be shown at the bottom of the survey page. 

Our front end uses Bootstrap to prettify the page and employs MVC framework in order to segment output representation and the behavior of the application. 

Stretch goals include: providing flight data for and reviews of suggested destinations, separating reviews of the app from reviews of destinations, providing hotel and restaurant data for suggested locations, as well as collecting reviews for hotels and restaurants in all locations.
